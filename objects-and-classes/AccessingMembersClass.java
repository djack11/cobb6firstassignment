class Bicycle {

  // field of class
  int gear = 5;

  // method of class
  void braking() {
    ...
  }
}

// create object
Bicycle sportsBicycle = new Bicycle();

// access field and method
sportsBicycle.gear;
sportsBicycle.braking();

// In the above example, we have created a class named Bicycle. It includes a field named gear and a method named braking(). Notice the statement,

// Bicycle sportsBicycle = new Bicycle();

// Here, we have created an object of Bicycle named sportsBicycle. We then use the object to access the field and method of the class.

// sportsBicycle.gear - access the field gear
// sportsBicycle.braking() - access the method braking()

// We have mentioned the word method quite a few times. You will learn about Java methods in detail in the next chapter.

// Now that we understand what is class and object. Let's see a fully working example.
