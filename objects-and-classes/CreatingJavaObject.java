// Creating an Object in Java

// Here is how we can create an object of a class.

// className object = new className();

// // for Bicycle class
 Bicycle sportsBicycle = new Bicycle();

 Bicycle touringBicycle = new Bicycle();

// We have used the new keyword along with the constructor of the class to create an object. Constructors are similar to methods and have the same name as the class. For example, Bicycle() is the constructor of the Bicycle class. To learn more, visit Java Constructors.

// Here, sportsBicycle and touringBicycle are the names of objects. We can use them to access fields and methods of the class.

// As you can see, we have created two objects of the class. We can create multiple objects of a single class in Java.

// Note: Fields and methods of a class are also called members of the class.
